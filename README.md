# `ratelimit_meter` is deprecated & in maintenance-only mode

In late 2019, I realized that a bunch of design decisions I made in
`ratelimit_meter` (one of my first "real" rust projects) meant that
some bugs were ~forever baked in. To fix that, I re-wrote the core of
this library as
[`governor`](https://github.com/antifuchs/governor). It is more
fully-featured, more modern, [less
buggy](https://github.com/antifuchs/ratelimit_meter/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22fixed+in+governor%22)
and it has way less potential for buggy usage.

There is a [migration guide](https://docs.rs/governor/~0.3/governor/_guide) available.

With the above in mind, please take the rest of this README with
several grains of salt (and use
[`governor`](https://crates.io/crates/governor) if you can)!

# Rate-Limiting with leaky buckets in Rust

This crate implements two rate-limiting algorithms in Rust:
* a [leaky bucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket#As_a_meter) and
* a variation on the leaky bucket, the
  [generic cell rate algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_cell_rate_algorithm) (GCRA)
  for rate-limiting and scheduling.

`ratelimit_meter` is usable in `no_std` mode, with a few trade-offs on
features.

## Installation

Add the crate `ratelimit_meter` to your `Cargo.toml`
file; [the crates.io page](https://crates.io/crates/ratelimit_meter)
can give you the exact thing to paste.

## API Docs

Find them [on docs.rs](https://docs.rs/ratelimit_meter/) for the latest version!

## Design and implementation

Unlike some other token bucket algorithms, the GCRA one assumes that
all units of work are of the same "weight", and so allows some
optimizations which result in much more concise and fast code (it does
not even use multiplication or division in the "hot" path for a
single-cell decision).

All rate-limiting algorithm implementations in this crate are
thread-safe. Here are some benchmarks for repeated decisions (run on
my macbook pro, this will differ on your hardware, etc etc):

## Contributions welcome!

I am actively hoping that this project gives people joy in using
rate-limiting techniques. You can use these techniques for so many
things (from throttling API requests to ensuring you don't spam people
with emails about the same thing)!

So if you have any thoughts about the API design, the internals, or
you want to implement other rate-limiting algotrithms, I would be
thrilled to have your input. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
for details!
