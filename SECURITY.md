# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

While this library still runs on latest rust, is no longer supported with the exception of critical fixes. These 
are restricted to the latest release, and newer releases are unlikely to get cut.

A newer, more modern, supported library exists in the form of [`governor`](https://github.com/antifuchs/governor).

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 4.0.x   | :white_check_mark: (:information_source: ) |
| < 4.x   | :x:                |
